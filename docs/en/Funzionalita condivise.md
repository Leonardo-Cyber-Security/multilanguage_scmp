After clicking on “Switch Tenant”, a modal appears where you can select a Tenant to switch to. After selecting the desired Tenant, click on the “Confirm” button.

The system automatically verifies the enablement and existence of the tenant before performing the switch.

## Managing Columns in Available Tables

For the tables available in SCMP, the user has the ability to customize the column display in two ways:

- Change the order of the displayed columns.
- Change the number of columns shown.

These preferences are saved within the system, using the user identifier and the current page as references.

To customize the display, you need to click on the “filter columns” button, which is shown with a “funnel” icon, available in the upper-right section of the respective table.

A configuration modal will open, containing the ordered list of all fields currently displayed on the interface.

We can use the “drag n’ drop” technique by clicking on the “Vertical Dots” button next to the field we want to move, and then releasing the component in the correct position.

Furthermore, it is possible to remove a field from the table by clicking on the red “X” next to the field to be deleted; this will remove it from the list, and after saving, it will also be removed from the table.

If we want to add a field to the table, it will be necessary to click the “Add column” button; once pressed, it will be replaced by a “select” field containing a list of all available fields that are not already present in the table.

The page will automatically update to display the new table; furthermore, the configuration will be saved automatically and retrieved automatically upon login.
