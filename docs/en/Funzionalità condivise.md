After clicking on “Switch Tenant”, a modal appears where you can select a Tenant to switch to. After selecting the desired Tenant, click on the “Confirm” button.

The system automatically verifies the tenant's enablement and existence before performing the switch.

## Managing Columns in Available Tables

For the tables available in SCMP, the user has the ability to customize the column display in two ways:

- Modify the order of the displayed columns.
- Change the number of columns shown.

These preferences are saved within the system, using the user identifier and the current page as references.

To customize the display, it is necessary to click on the “filter columns” button, shown with a “funnel” icon, available in the top right section of the respective table.

A configuration modal will open, containing the ordered list of all fields currently displayed on the interface.

We can use the “drag n’ drop” technique by clicking on the “Vertical dots” button corresponding to the field we want to move, then we can release the component in the correct position.

Additionally, it is possible to remove a field from the table by clicking on the red “X” corresponding to the field to be deleted; this will be removed from the list and, after saving, will also be removed from the table.

If we want to add a field to the table, it will be necessary to click the “Add column” button; once pressed, it will be replaced by a “select” field which contains the list of all available fields not already present in the table.
