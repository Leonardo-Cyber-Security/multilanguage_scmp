# Dashboard

Accessing the SCMP, the homepage presents a summary of four sections: inventory, monitoring, costs, and security.

In particular:

- The Inventory section shows:
- A pie chart regarding SCMP resources (for each resource of a single provider, an SCMP type instance is created, so the data can be considered as the sum of all resources present across all providers).
- A pie chart for each provider type.
- The monitoring section shows the most populated metrics with their relative usage.
- The costs section shows a summary of costs for the last 30 days.
- The security section shows the most severe vulnerabilities.

The title of each section is clickable and leads to the specific dashboard.
