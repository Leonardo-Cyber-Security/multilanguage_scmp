### General Dashboard

At this point, the user is on the “Dashboard” tab page where the security data of resources for all configured providers are shown in an aggregated manner.

At the top, there is a filter bar that allows filtering results by subsystem, status, and/or policy name.

After that, the user notices the presence of the bar chart indicating the compliance status of resources assigned to policies, subdivided by subsystem.

By hovering the mouse over a section of the chart, we can see that the values displayed on the page are updated to show a preview of the detail.

It is possible to click on a section of the chart to automatically apply the “subsystem” and “status” filters to the page.

Scrolling down the page, there is the policies table which will be automatically filtered based on the selected filters.

Clicking on a row in the table will open a detail window where you can find all information related to the selected policy, and the list of affected resources will also be available. It is possible to click on the name of a machine to view its details; in this case, the user will be redirected to the SCMP inventory resource in “view” mode.

To exit the detail, you need to click outside the window, which will close automatically.

### Dashboards specific to resource type

It is possible to further filter policies by resource type, using the tabs at the top of the page.

Once the resource type is selected, it is possible to navigate the pages following the methods described in the previous paragraph.

At this point, the user is on the “Dashboard” tab page where all alerts generated by the configured “Cluster” type subsystems in SCMP are shown in an aggregated manner.

At the top, there is a filter bar that allows filtering results by namespace, subscription, and/or policy name.

After that, the user notices the presence of the bar chart indicating the total number of “alerts” received, subdivided by subsystem.

By hovering the mouse over a section of the chart, we can see that the values displayed on the page are updated to show a preview of the detail.

It is possible to click on a section of the chart to automatically apply the “subsystem” filter.

At this point, the user is on the "Compliance" tab page, composed of 4 sections.
The first section contains filters that allow searching by policy name, subsystem, and/or compliance status.
The second section, always active, contains pie charts that indicate the general status of the filtered resources.

![“Filters” and “pie charts” sections](assets/images/extract/media/120325002.png)

The third section, active only if multiple different subsystems are present in the results, shows a bar chart, subdivided by provider, of the compliance status of resources.
The last section contains a table with general information on policy groups.

![“Bar charts” and “table” sections](assets/images/extract/media/120325003.png)

Clicking on a row in the table opens a modal where it will be possible to view the list of all policies configured in the group, with the relative resource count.
Still within the modal, we can click on one of the displayed policies; doing so will show at the bottom the list of all machines assigned to the policy and their respective status.
Next to each resource, a "link" button is available; once clicked, the user will be redirected to the inventory page of the selected resource.
